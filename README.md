Current learning models have implicit bias based on what data they are trained on. The purpose of this tool is to train a model specifically on data of our choosing, which is beneficial to small scale projects that are built for specific processes and understandings.

The word *bark* can be interpreted multiple ways in the english language. *Bark*, *barking*, *to bark*... are all things a dog does while *bark* is also the outer layer of a tree. We understand the meaning of the word bark soley on the context of if it is a verb, or a noun. Similar to language recognition we have similar multi-meanings when it comes to identifying objects. When we look at a tomato, we can assume it's a tomato, however, there is a possibility that it is actually a red ball.

planVision is made specifically to define the bias in the learning process specifically to the application that we are building learning models for. Enabling a library of understanding that is incredibly specific, and fine-tuned to the requirements of the model we need has the benefit of being able to focus on the context we need the model to focus on.
